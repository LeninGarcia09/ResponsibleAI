## Option 1: Technical Audience (Data Scientists, ML Engineers)

🏦 **New Open-Source Demo: Detecting & Fixing Bias in AI Loan Decisions**

Just published a hands-on notebook demonstrating end-to-end fairness for financial AI — from bias detection to regulatory compliance.

**The problem we tackle:**
A biased loan model denies 1,582 qualified applicants — disproportionately affecting women (24pp approval gap) and young applicants (34pp gap for 18-25 year olds).

**What the demo covers:**
📊 Disparate impact analysis across gender, age, and ethnicity
⚖️ Two Microsoft Fairlearn mitigation approaches (GridSearch + ExponentiatedGradient)
🔍 SHAP explanations for adverse action notices (ECOA compliance)
📈 Production fairness monitoring dashboard

**Key result:** Both Fairlearn approaches bring the model into 80% rule compliance while maintaining 85%+ accuracy.

Everything runs on synthetic data — safe to clone, run, and learn from.

## Option 2: Business/Leadership Audience

⚖️ **Can Your AI Lending Model Pass a Fair Lending Audit?**

Financial institutions are under increasing scrutiny to ensure AI-powered loan decisions don't discriminate. But how do you actually test for bias — and fix it without sacrificing accuracy?

I built an interactive demo that walks through the complete lifecycle:

1️⃣ **Detect** → A biased model rejects 1,582 qualified applicants unfairly
2️⃣ **Measure** → Disparate impact ratio of 0.76 fails the regulatory 80% rule
3️⃣ **Fix** → Microsoft Fairlearn brings it to 0.97 while keeping accuracy above 85%
4️⃣ **Explain** → SHAP generates the adverse action notices required by ECOA
5️⃣ **Monitor** → A production dashboard tracks fairness metrics over time

The takeaway: fairness and accuracy aren't a tradeoff — with the right tools, you can have both.
