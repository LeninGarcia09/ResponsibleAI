    "# 🏦 Financial Services — Loan Decision Fairness Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Responsible AI principles for financial lending decisions** using Microsoft's **Fairlearn** and **SHAP** to detect, measure, mitigate, and explain bias in loan approval models.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Why this matters**: Biased AI models in lending can deny credit to qualified applicants based on gender, age, or ethnicity — violating regulations like the **Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)** and causing real financial harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "| Step | What We Do | Why It Matters |\n",
    "|------|-----------|----------------|\n",
    "| **1. Data Exploration** | Examine 10,000 synthetic loan applications | Understand demographic distribution and financial profiles |\n",
    "| **2. Bias Detection** | Measure disparate impact across protected groups | Identify regulatory violations (80% rule) |\n",
    "| **3. Mitigation — GridSearch** | Apply Fairlearn GridSearch + Demographic Parity | Find optimal fairness-accuracy tradeoff |\n",
    "| **4. Mitigation — Equalized Odds** | Apply Fairlearn ExponentiatedGradient | Ensure equal TPR/FPR across groups |\n",
    "| **5. Comparison** | Scorecard across all models | Quantify improvement |\n",
    "| **6. Explainability** | SHAP-based adverse action notices | Meet ECOA transparency requirements |\n",
    "| **7. Monitoring** | Production fairness dashboard | Continuous compliance tracking |\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAI Principles Demonstrated\n",
    "- ⚖️ **Fairness** — Detect and mitigate disparate impact across demographics\n",
    "- 🔍 **Transparency** — Explain adverse loan decisions with SHAP\n",
    "- 📋 **Accountability** — Audit trail and fairness monitoring\n",
    "- 📜 **Regulatory Compliance** — ECOA, Fair Lending practices\n",

    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.11+ with dependencies installed (`pip install -r ../setup/requirements.txt`)\n",
    "- Generated loan data (`loan_applications.csv`) — run `python ../data/generate_loan_data.py`\n",

      "======================================================================\n",
      "  • Fair model denials (1,867) are driven by financial risk factors\n",
      "    (credit score, DTI, delinquencies) — evenly distributed across genders.\n",
      "  • The biased model injects penalties based on gender (Female: -10)\n",
      "    and age (18-25: -12, 26-35: -8), simulating historical bias.\n",
      "  • These penalties cause 1,582 additional applicants to be wrongly denied.\n",
      "  • Female and younger applicants are disproportionately affected.\n",
      "  • Ethnicity is NOT directly biased in this model, but correlated\n",
      "    features may still produce differential outcomes.\n",
      "  • Next sections will use Microsoft Fairlearn to detect & fix this.\n"

    "### ✅ What We Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bias Detection**\n",
    "   - Identified disparate impact violations in the biased baseline model\n",
    "   - Calculated fairness metrics across protected groups (gender, ethnicity)\n",
    "   - Visualized approval rate disparities against the 80% regulatory threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bias Mitigation (Two Microsoft Fairlearn Approaches)**\n",
    "   - **Fairlearn GridSearch + Demographic Parity**: Generated candidate models with optimal fairness-accuracy tradeoff\n",
    "   - **Fairlearn ExponentiatedGradient + Equalized Odds**: Applied constrained optimization for group-level parity\n",
    "   - Both approaches maintained strong model accuracy while improving fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explainability with SHAP**\n",
    "   - Generated SHAP explanations for adverse action notices\n",
    "   - Provided theoretically grounded, consistent feature attributions\n",
    "   - Enabled transparent, auditable decision-making per ECOA requirements\n",
    "   - Showed both local (per-applicant) and global feature importance\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Continuous Monitoring**\n",
    "   - Built production dashboard for real-time fairness tracking\n",
    "   - Set up alerts for disparate impact threshold violations\n",
    "   - Established governance process for model retraining\n",
